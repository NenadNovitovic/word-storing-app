# word-storing-app
A simple JavaFX app that I'm making for myself to have a better looking UI instead of saving the data in a txt file.

Was pracitcing a bit of JavaFX with this little app, it just shows words and their translation (with some bonus info) in a neat UI.
Using gson to switch to and from json and saving the data in a txt file.
